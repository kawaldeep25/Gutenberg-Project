## Terms of service
The Flutter tool may occasionally download resources from Google servers. By
downloading or using the Flutter SDK, you agree to the Google Terms of Service:
https://policies.google.com/terms
For example, when installed from GitHub (as opposed to from a prepackaged
archive), the Flutter tool will download the Dart SDK from Google servers
immediately when first run, as it is used to execute the `flutter` tool itself.
This will also occur when Flutter is upgraded (e.g. by running the `flutter
upgrade` command).
## About Flutter
We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,
extensible and open development model, whether you're targeting iOS or Android,
web, Windows, macOS, Linux or embedding it as the UI toolkit for a platform of
your choice.
